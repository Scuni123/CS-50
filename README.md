# Havards CS 50 Python Specific Course

This was a follow along exercise to get a strong foundation for python basics. Main learnings were
- Functions
- Conditions
- Loops
- Exceptions
- Libraries
- Unit Tests
- Input/Output
- Regular Expressions

### Other learnings
Specifcally for this project, I used Git to initialize a repository locally then push the contents to this online repository on Github. I still need a much stronger understanding of Git and how to use it to peform the version control tasks, but this is a start.

I also wanted to work on setting up a requirements.txt file to show what I was specifically using in my .venv.
